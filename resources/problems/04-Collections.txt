Write Student class with name and age properties. Create a list of Students and sort list based on below conditions:
1. Sort based on name.
2. If names are same, then sort based on age.
3. Reverse sorting, sort in descending order -> name and age

	Comparable



4. We have 100 students in student list and want to sort them by age and remove last student from the list. (What should be used LinkedList, ArrayList or both)
	Comparator

	for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
		new Student("name"+i, (int)Math.random()*100)
	}
	
=========================================

5. Convert ArrayList into LinkedList and LinkedList into ArrayList.
